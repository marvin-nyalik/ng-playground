Angular component lifecycle hooks are special methods
 in a component or directive that allow you to tap into
 key moments during its creation, update, and destruction. 

constructor() - Called first when the component is instantiated.

ngOnChanges() - Called when an @Input() property changes.

ngOnInit() - Called once after the first ngOnChanges(). INITIALIZATION LOGIC

ngDoCheck() - Called during every change detection run. CUSTOM CHANGE DETECTION

ngAfterContentInit() - Called once after projecting external content into the component.

ngAfterContentChecked() - After every check of projected content

ngAfterViewInit() - Once after a component and its children views have been initialized

ngAfterViewChecked() - After every check of component and child views

ngOnDestroy() - Just before the component is destroyed
